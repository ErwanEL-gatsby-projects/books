**The fastlane roadmap: The playbook for wealth**

&nbsp;Yes, become a producer first and a consumer second. Applied, this means instead of buying products on TV, sell products. Instead of digging for gold, sell shovels. Instead of taking a class, offer a class. Instead of borrowing money, lend it. Instead of taking a job, hire for jobs. Instead of taking a mortgage, hold a mortgage. Break free from consumption, switch sides, and reorient to the world as producer.

Acquire the producer mindset.

To consume richly, produce effectively.

Be a producer: Leverage the business of a system.

**Summary**

---Producers are indigenous to the Fastlane roadmap. Producers are the minority as are the rich, while consumers are the majority as are the poor. When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want. Fastlaners are producers, entrepreneurs, innovators, visionaries, and creators. A business does not make a Fastlane-some businesses are jobs in disguise. The Fastlane wealth equation is not bound by time and its variables are unlimited and controllable.

**How the rich really get rich**

> “_Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go_” >-TS Eliot

Wealth = net profit + asset value

Net profit = (unit sold) x (unit profit)

Asset value = (net profit) x (industry multiplier)

1. Raise units sold by increasing conversion ratio.
2. Raise units sold by increasing web traffic.
3. Raise unit profit.
